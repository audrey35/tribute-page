        <h3 id="headline">About Eddie Woo</h3>
        <p>
            Eddie Woo's parents moved from Malaysia to Australia in the 1970s to provide better
            education for their children. He was born in Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia, in
            1985. As he grew up, he dreamed of becoming a teacher, but his parents were opposed to
            the idea. Regardless, he continued to work towards his dream and in 2008, received his
            Bachelor of Education in Secondary Mathematics and Information Technology from the
            University of Sydney.</p>
        <p>
            Now, he is officially a math teacher at Cherrybrook Technology High School, Sydney and
            unofficially a math teacher to numerous students globally via his YouTube channel, <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0EGvLTyy-LLT1oUSO_0FQ"
                title="WooTube YouTube link" target="_blank">WooTube</a>. Many praise him because he
            explains complex math concepts by showing how you can solve the problem just using the
            concepts you already know and showing how the equations are derived. This is in stark
            contrast to how math is usually taught, memorizing the relevant equations and when each
            equation needs to be used, then applying them to various problems to solve the problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considering his ability to teach math so well, one would think he is a math genius, but
            surprisingly that is not the case. In fact, he did not do well in math in high school.
            His favorite subjects were English and history. But, his lack of exceptional talent in
            math is what makes him such a great teacher since he can relate to the average student
            who has a hard time with math.
